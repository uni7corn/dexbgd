</p>

A real debugger for Android apps. Not a hooking framework, not JDWP - a native JVMTI debugger that lets you pause any Java method, step through Dalvik bytecode one instruction at a time, inspect every local variable and register, search the live heap, and force methods to return whatever you want.

Built for CTF, malware analysis and reverse engineering. Thin C++ agent inside the app, Rust TUI on the host.

## How It Differs from Frida?

Frida replaces functions with JavaScript hooks. dexbgd **pauses execution** and lets you look around. Different tools for different problems.

| | dexbgd | Frida |
|---|---|---|
| Stop at any bytecode | Yes | No (method-level only) |
| Step instruction by instruction | Yes | No |
| Read every local/register while paused | Yes | Only what your hook captures |
| Force a return value on the fly |Yes, `fr false` | Yes (write a hook script) |
| Built-in DEX disassembler | Yes, live PC & frames | Need external tools (jadx, baksmali) |
| Live heap search | `heap SecretKey` | Custom scripting required |
| Auto-intercept dynamic class loading | Built-in | Requires scripting |
| Native code | JNI monitor + redirect | Yes (multi-arch native) |
| Detection surface | Standard debug API + optional ptrace | frida-server, gadget, ptrace |
| Requires debuggable | Yes (or bypass via root + ptrace) | No (needs root or repackage) |

**Use dexbgd** when you need fine-grained visibility into execution - stepping through root checks, observing crypto state during execution, tracing dynamic class loading, or bypassing logic instruction-by-instruction.

## What can it do / Quick Start

```
// Terminal 1
> adb forward tcp:12345 localabstract:dexbgd
> adb shell cmd activity attach-agent com.sketchy.apkapp libart_jit_tracer.so

// Terminal 2 (server TUI)
> launch com.sketchy.apkapp
  (same as adb shell am start -n com.sketchy.apkapp/.MainActivity)
  Connected (pid=12847, Android 14, arm64)
  Loaded APK: 847 classes, 6203 methods

> bp-detect
  Set 14 breakpoints on root/tamper detection APIs

> c
  Breakpoint #3 hit: Debug.isDebuggerConnected @0

> fr false
  [forced return false, paused at caller]

> c
  Breakpoint #7 hit: RootBeer.isRooted @0

> fr false
  [app thinks device is clean, continues]

> bp-crypto
> c
  Breakpoint #31 hit: Cipher.init @0

> locals
  opmode = 1 (ENCRYPT)
  key = SecretKeySpec{AES, [4b 65 79 31 32 33 ...]}

> eval v2.getAlgorithm()
  "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"

> strings http
  [apk] "https://c2server.evil.com/exfil"
  [apk] "http://license.check.net/verify"

> xref-bp c2server
  Set bp on MainActivity.sendData (loads "https://c2server.evil.com/exfil")
```

## Features

### Breakpoint profiles

One command covers an entire attack surface:

```
bp-crypto       Cipher, SecretKeySpec, IvParameterSpec, Mac, MessageDigest, KeyGenerator, KeyStore
bp-network      URL, HttpURLConnection, HttpsURLConnection, Socket, OkHttp
bp-exec         Runtime.exec, ProcessBuilder, DexClassLoader, PathClassLoader, InMemoryDexClassLoader, Method.invoke, Class.forName, ClassLoader.loadClass
bp-detect       Debug.isDebuggerConnected, SafetyNet, Play Integrity, File.exists, SystemProperties, ActivityManager, Settings$Secure, signature checks
bp-exfil        TelephonyManager, ContentResolver, SMS, Location, PackageManager.getInstalledPackages
bp-ssl          NetworkSecurityTrustManager, SSLContext.init, HttpsURLConnection, OkHttp CertificatePinner, Conscrypt TrustManagerImpl
bp-all          All of the above
```

### Force return

Make any method return whatever you want while it's suspended. The agent figures out the return type automatically.

```
fr true         isRooted() -> true? Not anymore.
fr false        isDebuggerConnected() -> false.
fr null         getSignature() -> null. Signature check bypassed.
fr 42           getRetryCount() -> 42. Why not.
```

After forcing the return, execution pauses at the caller's next instruction so you can see the effect before continuing.

### Silent anti-tamper bypass (`anti`)

`bypass-ssl` silently intercepts SSL pinning. `anti` does the same for any method — it sets a ghost breakpoint that auto-ForceEarlyReturns a neutral value without pausing or showing anything to the user.

Three ways to find what to hook:

```
// Direct: name the method
anti com.example.Security isRooted

// xref: find methods that load a suspicious string constant
anti xref su
anti xref test-keys
anti xref Superuser

// callers: find methods that invoke a specific API
anti callers android.os.Debug isDebuggerConnected
```

Example against the test app on a rooted device:

```
> attach com.test.profiletest
  [press Detect button -> "Root: DETECTED (1)"]

> anti xref su
  anti xref "su": 1 unique method(s) - setting anti hooks...
    MainActivity.testDetect ("/system/xbin/su")

  [press Detect button -> "Root: not detected (0)"]
  [anti] MainActivity.testDetect()I -> 0/false/null

> anti list
  1 active anti hook(s):
    #3 MainActivity.testDetect

> anti clear
```

Return value is auto-detected from the JNI signature (`Z/B/I/...` -> `false`/`0`, `V` -> `void`). Override with an explicit value:

```
anti com.example.License check true      // always pass
anti com.example.Integrity verify void   // silently swallow
```

### Dynamic DEX interception

When `bp-exec` is active and the app loads code at runtime (DexClassLoader, InMemoryDexClassLoader), dexbgd automatically:
1. Dumps the loaded DEX bytes
2. Parses class/method/string tables
3. Merges them into the searchable symbol data

So `strings` and `xref` cover both the original APK and dynamically loaded payloads - the stuff malware actually tries to hide.

### Conditional breakpoints

```
bp Cipher init --when "v1 == 1"         Break only on ENCRYPT mode
bp HttpURLConnection connect --every 5   Break every 5th call
bp LicenseCheck verify --hits 3          Break only on 3rd hit
```

See [doc/breakpoint_cond.md](doc/breakpoint_cond.md) for the full expression syntax and more examples.

### Call recording

Record security-relevant API calls as an indented call tree:

```
> record
> c
  [app runs for a while]
> record
  Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")
    SecretKeySpec.<init>([...], "AES")
    Cipher.init(1, SecretKeySpec)
    Cipher.doFinal([...]) -> [encrypted bytes]
  URL.<init>("https://c2server.evil.com/exfil")
    HttpURLConnection.connect()
```

### AI-assisted analysis (experimental)

Point an LLM at the debugger and let it drive:

```
> ai Find all crypto keys used by this app and trace where the ciphertext goes
> ai ask Bypass root detection              (confirms each tool call)
> ai explain What is this method doing?     (read-only inspection)
```

The AI gets access to all debugger tools - it can set breakpoints, step, inspect variables, search strings, and build a report. Supports Claude API and local Ollama models.

See [doc/ai_setup.md](doc/ai_setup.md) for setup instructions.

## Command reference

See [doc/all_commands.md](doc/all_commands.md) for the full, up-to-date list of commands.

### Connection
```
procs / ps              List debuggable processes
attach <pkg>            Inject agent + connect + load symbols
launch <pkg>            Start app + attach
connect                 Manual connect (127.0.0.1:12345)
disconnect / dc         Disconnect
```

### Exploration
```
cls [pattern]           Search loaded classes
methods / m <class>     List methods
fields / f <class>      List fields
threads / thd           List all threads
dis <class> <m>         Disassemble method
u <class.method>        Navigate to method (WinDbg-style unassemble)
strings <pattern>       Search DEX constant pool
xref <pattern>          Find code referencing a string
xref-bp <pattern>       xref + set breakpoints
apk <path|pkg>          Load APK symbols
```

### Breakpoints
```
bp <cls> <method> [sig] [@loc]   Set breakpoint
bp2 <cls> <method> [sig] [@loc]  Set breakpoint + force deopt (for repacked APKs)
  --hits N / --every N / --when "expr"
bc / bd <id>            Clear breakpoint
bc / bd *               Clear all
bl                      List breakpoints
```

> **`bp2`**: On repacked APKs, ART may silently fail to deoptimize methods — `bp` succeeds but never fires. `bp2` forces deoptimization via `RetransformClasses` after setting the breakpoint. Use `bp2` instead of `bp` when debugging repacked apps.

### Execution
```
c / g / F5              Continue
si / F7                 Step into
s / n / F8              Step over
sout / finish / F9      Step out
pause / F6              Suspend thread
fr <value>              Force return (true/false/null/void/0/1/<int>)
```

### Inspection
```
locals / l              Local variables
stack / bt              Call stack
inspect / i <vN>        Object fields
eval / e <expr>         Evaluate (v3.getAlgorithm())
hexdump / hd <vN>       Hex dump arrays/strings
hexdump / hd <vN> full  Extended hex dump (32 rows)
heap <class>            Search heap instances
heapstr <pattern>       Search live strings
r / regs                Dump registers
```

### Watch
```
watch <expr>        Add expression to watch list (re-evaluated on every suspension)
unwatch <n|expr>    Remove watch by index or expression
unwatch *           Remove all watches
watch clear         Same as unwatch *

e.g.
watch key
watch v3
watch v3.getAlgorithm()
```

### Bookmarks
```
Ctrl+B              Toggle bookmark at bytecode cursor
bm <label>          Rename selected bookmark (or press Enter in Bookmarks tab)
```

### Session (per-app persistent state)

Aliases, comments, bookmarks, and hooks are saved per app in `sessions/<package>.json` next to the server binary.

```
Ctrl+S              Save session for current app
Ctrl+L              Launch session picker (select saved app, start and attach agent)

n                   Rename current class (IDA-style, bytecodes panel only)
                    Empty input removes the alias.

alias <sig> <label> Set display alias  e.g. alias Lcom/a/B; CertPinner
alias list          List all aliases
alias clear <sig>   Remove alias (or * for all)

hook <cls> <m> <action>   Add app-specific intercept hook (auto-applied on next connect)
hook list                 List hooks
hook clear <cls> <m>      Remove hook (or * for all)

Actions: log-continue, force-return-void, force-return-0, force-return-1
```

Hooks also accept `--action` on any `bp` command for one-off use:
```
bp Cipher doFinal --action log-continue
bp Lcom/a/B; isRooted --action force-return-0
```

### Patching
```
patch <cls> <m> void|true|false|null|0|1   Replace method body
patch <cls> <m> @0xOFFSET nop              Nop single instruction
nop-range 0xOFFSET                         Nop from current PC to offset (takes effect at next entry)
bypass-ssl                                 Auto-bypass SSL pinning (NSC, Conscrypt, OkHttp)
anti <cls> <m> [val]                       Silent ghost BP: ForceReturn neutral value on hit
anti xref <pattern>                        Same, auto-discover via string xref
anti callers <cls> <m>                     Same, auto-discover by scanning invoke instructions
anti list / anti clear                     Manage active anti hooks
```

Class accepts simple name, dot-notation, or full JNI descriptor:
```
patch MainActivity testDetect false
patch com.example.Security isRooted false
patch Lcom/example/app/License; checkLicense true
patch Telemetry sendData void
```

### Recording & DEX
```
record / rec        Toggle recording
rec tree/flat       Switch trace format
rec clear           Clear recorded calls
rec onenter         Entry-only (no exit/return lines)
dex-dump            Extract DEX from DexClassLoader
dex-read <path>     Read DEX from device
```

### JNI Monitor

Intercepts `RegisterNatives` calls to map Java methods to native function pointers, then lets you swap those pointers with stubs — without patching native code or triggering integrity checks.

```
jni monitor         Hook JNIEnv::RegisterNatives (all threads)
jni stop            Stop monitoring, restore vtable
jni clear           Clear captured binding list
```

Click the **JNI** tab in the tab bar to view captured bindings. Right-click anywhere in the JNI panel to start/stop monitoring, or right-click a binding to get a context menu with the function name and Redirect / Restore options — no typing required.

Each captured binding is shown as:

```
libnative.so+0x1b10         Shield.boolean checkIntegrity()
libnative.so+0x2c40         Shield.byte[] getKey(byte[])
libapp.so+0x4000            App.void nativeInit()
```

The lib+offset is stable across runs (ASLR-independent) and maps directly to Ghidra.

**Redirect a native method to a stub:**

```
jni redirect <class_sig> <method_name> <method_sig> <action>
jni redirect <lib+0xOFFSET | 0xADDR> <action>

Actions:
  block       return 0 / null / false / void  (by return type)
  true        return 1  (for boolean methods)
  spoof N     return integer N

Examples:
jni redirect Lcom/guard/Shield; checkIntegrity ()Z block
jni redirect Lcom/guard/Shield; isDebugger ()Z false
jni redirect Lcom/guard/Shield; getTrialCount ()I spoof 999

# Same thing using the address shown in the JNI panel (copy-paste friendly):
jni redirect libnative.so+0x1b10 block
jni redirect 0x7a3f2b10 true
```

**Restore the original:**

```
jni restore Lcom/guard/Shield; checkIntegrity ()Z
jni restore libnative.so+0x1b10
jni restore 0x7a3f2b10
```

Restore requires the original pointer to have been captured by `jni monitor` first.

**Typical workflow for a native protector:**

```
> jni monitor
> c
  [app initializes — native libs load and call RegisterNatives]
  libnative.so+0x1b10  Shield.boolean checkIntegrity()  [->block]
  libnative.so+0x2c40  Shield.boolean isRooted()
  libnative.so+0x3a80  Shield.String getKey(String)

> jni redirect Lcom/guard/Shield; checkIntegrity ()Z block
  JNI redirect installed: Lcom/guard/Shield;.checkIntegrity
> jni redirect Lcom/guard/Shield; isRooted ()Z block
  JNI redirect installed: Lcom/guard/Shield;.isRooted

> jni stop
> c
  [app continues — both native integrity checks silently return false]
```

## Targeting non-debuggable apps

JVMTI requires `android:debuggable="true"`, which production apps omit. Two approaches:

### Option A: Repackage with apktool

Works for most apps. Resigning breaks the original signature, so apps with signature verification will detect the modification. On repacked APKs, use `bp2` instead of `bp` if breakpoints set but never fire — see [Breakpoints](#breakpoints) for details.

**Automated (recommended):**
```bash
# Build agent first
cd agent && scripts/build.sh    # or build.bat on Windows

# adb pull, patch, repack, and sign the APK
python agent/scripts/repackage.py com.target.app
# Follow the on-screen install command

# Connect
cd server && cargo run
> launch com.target.app
```

The repackage script automates everything: pulls the APK (including splits) from the device, decodes with apktool, patches `android:debuggable="true"` and `android:extractNativeLibs="true"`, injects the agent `.so`, rebuilds, signs, and prints the install command. It also pauses after decoding so you can edit smali files before rebuild.

**Early-attach with `--gate` (inspect code before `onCreate` runs):**

```bash
python agent/scripts/repackage.py --gate com.target.app
# Follow the on-screen install command

cd server && cargo run
> launch com.target.app
```

The `--gate` flag injects a spin-loop into the main Activity's `onCreate` so the app pauses at startup waiting for the server. Once connected, type:

```
> gate
```

This sets a breakpoint at `GateWait.gateReleased` and releases the gate — the app resumes and breaks immediately, letting you step from the very first lines of `onCreate`.

**Manual steps (for reference):**
1. `apktool d target.apk`
2. Add `android:debuggable="true"` to `AndroidManifest.xml`
3. Copy `libart_jit_tracer.so` into `target/lib/arm64-v8a/`
4. `apktool b target/`
5. Sign with a debug key and install
6. `adb shell am start -n com.target.app/.MainActivity`
7. `adb shell cmd activity attach-agent com.target.app libart_jit_tracer.so`

### Option B: ptrace injection (no repackaging)

For apps with signature verification. Requires root. Tested on Pixel 7a (Android 14, user build).

> **Note:** This path patches ART runtime internals at hardcoded offsets. It is device and Android version specific and may not work (or may crash) on other ROMs or Android versions.

First build the injector (`agent\injector\build.bat`), then copy the agent into the app's native lib directory:

```
adb push libart_jit_tracer.so /data/local/tmp/
adb shell su -c "cp /data/local/tmp/libart_jit_tracer.so /data/app/*/com.target.app*/lib/arm64/"
```

Then attach:

```
agent/scripts/attach_any.bat com.target.app --ptrace
```

`attach_any` auto-discovers the launcher activity and handles split APKs — use it instead of `attach.bat` for production apps that don't use `.MainActivity`. It also supports `--quick` and `--sigstop` modes.

This injects the agent into the running process via ptrace — no APK modification needed.

## Building

### Build the agent
```bash
cd agent
scripts/build.sh       # Linux/Mac
scripts\build.bat      # Windows
```
Requires Android NDK (`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` set).

### Build and run the server
```bash
cd server
cargo run
```

### Connect to an app
From the TUI:
```
> launch com.target.app
```
One command handles app start, agent injection, port forwarding, connection, and APK symbol loading.

The target app must be `android:debuggable="true"`. For non-debuggable apps, repackage with apktool and resign (see [Targeting non-debuggable apps](#targeting-non-debuggable-apps)).

## Try it out

A ready-made test app is available at [arkup/dex_testapp_profiles](https://github.com/arkup/dex_testapp_profiles). It contains intentional root detection, crypto operations, and dynamic class loading — good for verifying your setup before pointing dexbgd at a real target.

```
> launch com.test.profiletest
> bp-detect
> c
```
